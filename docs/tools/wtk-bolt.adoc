WizToolKit delivers the `wtk::bolt` API for implementing ZK Backends in the IR.
The `wtk-bolt` command-line tool serves for testing this API in a _non-ZK_ and as an example of invoking the `wtk::bolt` API.
More information may be found in xref:{xref-rel-dir}backends.adoc#backends[WizToolKit for Backends].

`wtk::bolt` implements two intepreters, BOLT for relations with heavy use of loops and PLASMASnooze for relations which are largely IR-Simple.
PLASMASnooze also implements the Parser's xref:{xref-rel-dir}parser.adoc#Streaming-API[streaming API] for additional performance when parsing IR-Simple (rather than nearly simple).
Invocation is `wtk-bolt [ bolt | plasmasnooze | stream ] <relation.rel> <instance.ins> <witness.wit>`.
