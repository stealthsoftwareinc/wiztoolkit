= Sample Backend Code

We've put together these following backend code samples to get you started implementing.
While we can't really help you with the mathemagic, we can get you started with the nitty-gritty implementation details.
All of these should compile out of the box, after you've xref:../7_install.adoc[installed WizToolKit].

g++ -o wtk_demo demo_main.cpp /usr/local/lib/libwiztoolkit.a /usr/local/lib/libstealth_logging.a -lgmp

Care was taken that each successive demo-program may be ``diff``'d to highlight additional functionality.
