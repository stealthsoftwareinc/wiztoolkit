= `wtk-firealarm`

`wtk-firealarm` is a command line program for interpreting the SIEVE IR in a non-ZK setting.
FIREALARM stands for **F**riendly **IR** **E**valuator **A**nd **L**ogic **A**ssertion and **R**ejection **M**achine.

When given a single resource, `wtk-firealarm` will checks for well-formedness.
For a circuit, this means that each wire is assigned before it is used, and that it is never reused ("topological ordering", and "single static assignment (SSA)"), along with other checks.
For a public or private input stream, this simply means that each value in the stream is a field-element (e.g. does not exceed the fieldâ€™s characteristic).

When given all resources necessary for a statement, `wtk-firealarm` will evaluate the statement in a Non-ZK environment, indicating if the proof should be valid or not (evaluation validity).
It can also generate a program trace at two levels of detail.

.Resources
`circuit`:: A Circuit-IR relation, exclusive with translation
`translation`:: A Translation-IR relation, exclusive with circuit (coming soon)
`public_input`:: A public input stream, must be paired with a private input stream of the same field, and the field must match one from the relation.
`private_input`:: A private input stream, must be paired with a public input stream of the same field, and the field must match one from the relation.

== Example Invocations
